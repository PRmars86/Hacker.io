# Hacker.io
A startup project inspired by a successful real world app where multiple users can login and post/manage contents they submit.

Add few improvements to make it infinitely scalable and easier to maintain. Low cost of operation and implement some functionalities to make much easier, fun and engaging for users to use.

## Tech stack:

Using React and NextJS (React Framework) in the client side.

Build an API/server using Node Express MongoDB.

Use AWS services such as S3 for files storage, SES for sending emails and EC2 for cloud hosting IAM for Identity and access management Route 53 for domain management along with custom rules/policy.

Use Mongo Atlas as Managed Database Service in the cloud.



## Aim of the project

Target millions of potentials users to use and engage with our app

Users could be anyone.. who finds a course, video or articles online... likes it and wants to share

The links they share will also be available in their dashboard for update/delete

A user could be someone who is a content creator like me... instructors, youtubers, blog and tutorial writers, book authors etc

Users will signup/signin to our app to post/share/like the links/urls

Users will do this to get free traffic... to get people's attention... sharing links for free


## Overview of the project

Login/Register System

Need a MongoDB that scale infinitely. We will use Mongo Atlas for this requirement.

Need a massive storage system that scale infinitely to store user uploaded image files. We will use AWS S3 (Simple Storage Service) for this requirement.

You never have to worry about how to manage millions of user uploaded files... let AWS take care of that! S3 pricing is the lowest in the market for storing infinite amount of data that is readily available worldwide throughout AWS data centers globally.

Need robust email service for sending emails for hundreds of thousands of users. We will use AWS SES (Simple Email Service) for this requirement.

You never have to worry about how to send email to millions and pay higher price ... let AWS take care of that! their rate of SES is the lowest in the market.

We will be using AWS EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) for hosting our backend NodeJS API and React/Next JS frontend, all within one instance.

Keep the cost as low as possible by using AWS services for storage, email and hosting.

The biggest issues of scaling web apps are storage and database scaling. That part will be handled by AWS. So we as a developer don't have to worry.

Our aim is to enable just 1 or 2 developer to maintain the entire project and continuously grow in future.
